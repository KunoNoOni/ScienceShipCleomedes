This is my submission for the 28th Ludum Dare and for my December game for OneGameAMonth. The theme for this Ludum Dare was "You on get one" so my idea was to do a shooter where you where you only get one shot every 20 seconds. This then morphed into an advoider game where you need to choose between getting 1 shot every 20 seconds or getting 5 secs of shields every 20 seconds. I also incuded a story to kind of tie everything together.

To compile this you will need Flixel 2.55 and Flixel Power Tools 1.9
